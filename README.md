# Pattern_Library

The purpose of this pattern library is to showcase 6 components and the component of my choice. The HTML code has been validated to ensure that all the HTML pages are up to date and of a high quality. 

Appropiate documentation contating the description and usage of the component has also been provided alongside each component. This documentation also provides code snippets to show how the component is made.
